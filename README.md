# CEASAR CIPHER ENCRYPTION

## INTRODUCTION  
The Ceasar Cipher is a tool for encryption. Each letter transforms into another letter, according to the Cipher. If you input a string, you will receive a new encoded string.  

This project was all about experimenting with Javasript and writing an algorithm to encrypt alphabetic strings using the Ceasar Cipher. This algorithm would be presented as a basic Javascript function that takes in a single parameter -- which is the string -- and return a completely new string. This new encrypted string should not overwrite the original string.

This project was a inspired by FreeCodeCamp's [Javascript Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/caesars-cipher).
